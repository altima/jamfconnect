# Jamf Connect

This repository contains open-source resources for use with or alongside Jamf Connect.

![](https://resources.jamf.com/images/logos/Jamf-Connect-color.png)

Jamf Connect users can leverage the following resources:

### Configuration Profiles

Jamf Connect supports many identity providers (IdPs) and custom settings, the `Configurations` folder includes example configuration profiles for supported identity providers and a template for setting up a custom IdP. Examples for advanced settings, such as menu bar actions and the Jamf Connect Notify screen are also available.

Import the sample profiles into the Jamf Connect Configuration application or configure settings directly into Jamf Pro.

**Note: Make sure to edit the example configuration profiles to use your organization's identity provider settings.**

### Extension Attributes

Jamf Connect writes data to the `com.jamf.connect.state` preference domain on computers, which can be used to populate inventory information in Jamf Pro via extension attributes. Many of the Extension Attributes available this repository are also available in Jamf Pro as built-in templates.

For more information about using Extension Attributes with Jamf Pro, see [Computer Extension Attributes](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Computer_Extension_Attributes.html) in the _Jamf Pro Documentation_.

Additional extension attributes curated by Jamf's Professional Services and Consulting Engineering teams are in `additional_extension_attributes` folder.

### Jamf Connect Scripts

Some Jamf Connect processes can be run via scripts:

- Use the [URI schemas](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-connect/documentation/Jamf_Connect_URL_Scheme.html) in scripts to perform simple actions.
- Read data from [com.jamf.connect.state.plist](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-connect/documentation/State_Settings_and_User_Status.html) to use in scripts.
- Execute the [authchanger](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-connect/documentation/authchanger.html) command-line tool to change the macOS loginwindow from a script or run certain actions with Jamf Connect at login.

### Helper Tools

The tools contained within this section of the repository are built to help deliver the best possible implementation of Jamf Connect.
